**✏️ NOTE: This is still being worked on...**

**...right now you can grab the shader code in `demo/components/canvas/shaders/cellshade-material/` and use it how you like. I'll get around to making it an actual extendable material, with more integration into THREE's shaderchunk/renderer ecosystem 😶‍🌫️**
